# ðŸ§  minimodel

Code to train and test models from the paper:  **Fengtong Du, Miguel Angel NÃºÃ±ez-Ochoa, Marius Pachitariu, Carsen Stringer.** *[A simplified minimodel of visual cortical neurons](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.30.601394v1)*, bioRxiv


## Installation

We recommend using a **clean Python environment** to avoid dependency conflicts.

Create and activate a new environment:
```bash
conda create -n minimodel-env python=3.10 -y
conda activate minimodel-env
```

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MouseLand/minimodel.git
cd minimodel
```

Install the required dependencies and minimodel module:
```bash
pip install -e .
```
## Example notebook
[mouse_pipeline.ipynb](https://github.com/MouseLand/minimodel/blob/main/notebooks/mouse_pipeline.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](
https://colab.research.google.com/github/dufengtong/minimodel/blob/master/notebooks/mouse_pipeline.ipynb)
: This notebook demonstrates how to use the minimodel module to train and test models on the mouse dataset. It includes data loading, fullmodel training and evaluation, and minimodel training and evaluation.



## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:


- `minimodel/`: Directory containing the main minimodel module code.
- `notebooks/`: Directory for Jupyter notebooks of training and testing models.
    - `data/`: Directory for storing image and recording files.
    - `checkpoints/`: Directory for storing model checkpoints.
- `setup.py`: Setup script for installing the minimodel module.

## Datasets

### Mouse dataset
You can download the mouse dataset from [Janelia's Figshare](https://janelia.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Towards_a_simplified_model_of_primary_visual_cortex/28797638) or use the following command:
```bash
wget https://janelia.figshare.com/ndownloader/articles/28797638/versions/2
```
This will download a zip file containing the mouse dataset. Unzip the file and place it in the `notebooks/data/` directory.

### Monkey dataset

The monkey data used to train our models comes from [Cadena et al. (2019)](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006897). To access and load this dataset, refer to the official GitHub repository: [Cadena2019PlosCB](https://github.com/sacadena/Cadena2019PlosCB).

To convert the monkey data into the format compatible with our models, run the notebook [monkey_data.ipynb](https://github.com/MouseLand/minimodel/blob/main/notebooks/data/mouse_pipeline.ipynb).

### Sensorium Model

To evaluate the CNN Baseline model from [Willeke et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08666) on our dataset, follow these steps:

1. Use this notebook to convert our data to the Sensorium competition format: [sensorium_format.ipynb](https://github.com/MouseLand/minimodel/blob/main/notebooks/data/sensorium_format.ipynb)

2. Train the model using the official Sensorium notebook: [1a_model_training_sensorium.ipynb](https://github.com/sinzlab/sensorium/blob/main/notebooks/model_tutorial/1a_model_training_sensorium.ipynb)
